# Path-Optimization-with-Turning-radius
This code is part of masters thesis based on path optimization for unmanned aerial vehicle under turning radius constraint. The turning radius for vehicle is implemented using inner and outer tangent concept. The problem type is based on maximum information gain path optimization. Gurobi solve is used to solve the optimization solver.
Vehicle dynamics is considered to make model more realistic.
